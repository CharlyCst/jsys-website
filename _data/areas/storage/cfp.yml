introduction:

  - paragraph: The increasing need to process data closer to the storage as well as the growing demand for enhancing data privacy and protection raises new challenges and opportunities for near-data processing across various computing domains. Within this context, the “active storage” area of JSys welcomes a wide range of research contributions in all aspects of designing, implementing, and evaluating near-storage data processing architectures, system software, storage systems, programming abstractions, security, privacy, and data reduction and processing techniques.
