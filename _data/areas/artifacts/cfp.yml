introduction:

  - paragraph: The Journal of Systems Research (JSys) contains an Artifact Evaluation Board (AEB) to assist with the review of two kinds of submissions. "Tool/benchmark papers" present new, open-source tools and benchmarks, and "solution papers" present new solutions to well-known problems. To be accepted for publication, a tool/benchmark or solution paper must be accompanied by the artifact it describes, and that artifact must pass a review by members of the AEB. Artifacts are expected to be well documented and easy to use by a third party.

  - paragraph: JSys is looking for senior graduate students, postdocs, and early-career researchers who would like to serve on the AEB. Members of the AEB serve for one year. There are four JSys submission deadlines per year (on February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1), and following each deadline, an AEB member may be asked to review up to three artifacts. The three reviews must all be completed in 1.5 months. Note that the evaluation of an artifact proceeds in parallel with the review of the associated paper.

  - paragraph: If you would like to be a member of the JSys Artifact Evaluation Board, please fill out and submit the following form.
