introduction:

  - paragraph: Distributed consensus is a foundational primitive in the engineering of resilient and consistent distributed systems. As society increasingly depends upon distributed systems in every facet of life, it is vital that systems are both highly available and consistent, even in the face of failures. Within this context, the “distributed consensus” area of JSys welcomes research contributions on all aspects of the design, implementation, and evaluation of distributed consensus protocols, as well as the closely related topics of atomic broadcast, leader election, and state machine replication.

  - paragraph: The “distributed consensus” area of JSys focuses on non-byzantine consensus. Papers on byzantine agreement and blockchains should be submitted to the “decentralized systems” area of JSys.
