introduction:

  - paragraph: Recent advances in wireless technologies and the advent of the Internet of Things have shaped the evolution of embedded systems towards networks of low-power or battery-less wireless devices often incorporating sensors, actuators, data processing, decision-making, as well as lightweight networking stacks. Such wirelessly-networked embedded systems already represent a cornerstone of today's digital society, due to their omnipresence in a variety of application domains with high societal relevance, such as smart homes, smart cities, smart grids, connected healthcare, precision agriculture, civil infrastructure monitoring, and cyber-manufacturing.

  - paragraph: Within this context, the "wireless embedded systems" area of JSys welcomes research contributions describing the architecture, design, implementation, and performance of innovative wirelessly-networked embedded systems, as well as works exploring specific communication, computing, and sensing aspects. Particularly relevant are results and insights substantiated by a strong experimental component on real-world devices, as well as contributions describing practical deployments and implementation experiences.
