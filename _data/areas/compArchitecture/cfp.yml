introduction:

  - paragraph: "JSys invites papers on research works that take the expanded view of computer architecture that involves programming languages, system software, software/hardware interface, and microarchitecture. We are, in particular, interested in research that addresses crosscutting qualities that are related to hardware/software interface, such as performance, energy/thermal efficiency, resiliency, security, applications, and environments. The expanded view of computer architecture enables co-design across the hierarchy from algorithms to devices to achieve the highest energy efficiency and performance. In addition, it allows specialization as much as possible within the design goals. The importance of cross-cutting research at the expanded view of architecture became even more prominent more recently by evidence showing the end of Dennard scaling, the explosion of machine learning systems, and issues such as the power demand of training large models such as GPT-3, scales ranging from ultra-low power wearable devices to exascale parallel and cloud computers."
