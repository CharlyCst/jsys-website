## Data file storage

- bios.yml contains all author info. These are used to generate sidebar bios for each article. I've gone back & forth about whether it's better to have bios in one place for updating or to treat them like historical artefacts. For the moment, I've chosen the "one place" approach so as to keep authors updated.

- feature is a place to store info for generating "special feature" submenus. The yml is used to generate a subtable of contents. Make a new file when you make a different special feature.

- xml is a place to put your data stuff like crossref and doaj deposit files.

- I used bio info from astronauts as an example. Because astronauts are amazing and should be in everything.
