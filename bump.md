# About Journal of Systems Research
The Journal of Systems Research(JSys) is a new diamond-access journal.

Diamond access indicates that the papers are free to read, submit, review, and publish.

The design of JSys borrows heavily from the databases, security, and crypto communities; it includes several interesting features:

One-shot Revisions. Authors get a single chance to revise their papers based on reviewer comments, forwhich they have three months after getting the “revise and resubmit” decision.
Quick Turn-Around. Initial decisions will be returned to authors in 1.5 months. Final decisions after revisions will be returned to authors in 5.5 months (1.5 initial review + 3 months for revision + 1 month for reviewing revised manuscript). The paper will be published at the latest one month after the final accept decision.
Light review load. A common problem many conferences face is being unable to find enough reviewers for all their submissions. JSys will return manuscripts to authors if the appropriate reviewers are already fully occupied; authors can then choose to submit at the next quarterly deadline or submit to a different conference or journal. By doing so, JSys aims to ensure high-quality of reviews by making sure that reviewers are not overloaded.
No cap on number of accepted papers. JSys is not tied to a conference, and hence does not have to consider constraints such as number of presentation slots. JSys will accept every paper deemed by reviewers as contributing to the field.
No page limits. JSys recognizes that current conferences force authors into describing their systems and techniques in 12 to 14 pages, regardless of the complexity of these systems. While this provides focus and works well for some papers, it is detrimental to some papers which need more space for fully describing the system and experiments. JSys does not enforce page limits, either for the submitted version, or the final camera-ready version.
Multiple paper types. Authors can submit one of different types of papers: regular, vision, systematization of knowledge, analysis, experience reports, or replicability studies. Each paper type has its own purpose, goal, and corresponding expectations. Reviewers are provided guidance on how to rightly evaluate each type of paper.
Papers are published together with their reviewers' name and a review summary. Each paper will have a “Reviewed by” line containing the names of the JSys editorial board members who reviewed the paper. Prior to publication, the reviewers and authors work together to make the paper as strong as possible. This provides more transparency in the review process as well as fair credit for the work of reviewers.

## Aim and Scope
The publishing system in computer science mainly relies on conferences, which has three major problems:

1. The number of papers that can be presented in a conference is limited, and that did not scale as fast as the community grew, leading to many good papers being"rejected" even though they propose interesting ideas and solid science.
2. Publishing in conference is expensive and cannot be afforded by researchers in many countries, essentially excluding them from the community as they lack the funds to register to and travel at international conferences.
3. High quality journals do exist but are less regarded than conferences, leading to chronic lack of reviewers and long reviewing process. Furthermore, few journals are open access, and those that are charge expensive article processing fess, therefore excluding researchers with limited funds, just like conferences.

The Journal of Systems Research (JSys) aims to address these problems by offering a high-quality journal for computer science systems research with guaranteed short review process and a diamond open access model; that is, free to read, free to publish. JSys proposes a forward-looking model of reviewing where the reviewers and the researchers work together to make each paper stronger, while preserving double-blind anonymity to limit bias; after acceptance, papers are published alongside a summary of the reviews and the name of their reviewers. This provides more transparency in the review process as well as fair credit for the work of reviewers.

# Policies

## Submission Policies

The editors reserve the right to determine the suitability of submissions. For additional information, please contact the editors.

JSys does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.

Submissions to JSys are processed via double-blind reviewing process. The submissions
must be made anonymous by the authors.

JSys does not use a plagiarism checking system. 

## Removal

Once published, a journal article cannot generally be revised or removed. We feel it is important to provide perpetual access to materials published whenever possible and appropriate. However, we will remove publications under special circumstances, including in the case of submission errors, rights violations, or inappropriate content. Please be aware, however, that even after the removal of a work, a citation to the work will remain in our system, along with a URL.

If you would like your work removed from eScholarship, please contact the editors.

## Revising Work

Once manuscripts are published, we are generally unable to revise them. If a significant error or omission is discovered, contact the editors.

## Rights and Permissions

Journal of Systems Research does not require copyright transfer, only permission to publish and archive the article. Copyright holders retain copyright ownership, granting a nonexclusive license to the journal and eScholarship to publish the article, meaning that the author may also publish it elsewhere. Before submitting an article to the journal, please be sure that all necessary permissions have been cleared in any third party material. All articles published in the journal are subject to the journal’s author agreement, which is available in the first step of the submission process or by contacting us to request a copy.

## Open Access statement

This is an open access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to the user or his/her institution. Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author. Journal of Systems Research uses a CC BY-NC license.

## Long-term preservation policy

All materials submitted to eScholarship are automatically deposited in CDL's Merritt Preservation Repository for long-term preservation.

# Submission Guidelines

Please submit your paper as a PDF on the OpenReview portal. Look at the call for papers for more details. 

Important Deadlines
Submission Deadlines: Mar 1st, May 1st, Aug 1st, Nov 1st 

A paper submitted by Mar 1st will receive initial reviews by April 15th. For papers receiving a Revise decision, the authors can revise and submit anytime in the next three months. If they submit by the 15th of the month (for example, by June 15), they will receive a final decision in one month (July 15). 

# Call for Papers: Per Area

# Systemization of Knowledge Papers

Systemization of Knowledge (SoK) papers evaluate, systematize, and contextualizeexisting knowledge. They provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area. The heart of the SoK paper isanalysis: analyzing the existing literature and providing insights that could not be obtained by simply reading each of the individual papers.

SoK papers analyze the current research landscape: identify areas that have enjoyed much research attention, point out open areas with unsolved challenges, and present a prioritization that can guide researchers to make progress on solving important challenges.

A SoK paper may contribute new insights by:

- Qualitative analysis of existing research
- Empirical analysis of open-source software
- Identifying future research directions or challenges that require the community attention
- Presenting a convincing, comprehensive taxonomy

Imagine that the SoK paper will be given to a junior PhD student. After reading it, they should have a good idea of where the area stands, and what challenges they could pursue. A great SoK paper will help set the agenda for the field by identifying research problems that could be worked on for the next 5 years. We do not require this of all SoK papers, but it is the ideal to aim for.

SoK papers will not be rejected for:

- Lack of novel techniques or systems
- Lack of empirical evaluation of proposed techniques

SoK papers may be rejected for:

- Being a simple literature survey with no added insight
- Covering a new research area or line of work where there are few research papers

Desk Rejections:

- On receiving the submission, the JSys editor-in-chief will do a quick check of the submission. If either rejection criteria apply, the submission will be rejected without further review.

Guideline for authors:

- Prefix the title of these papers with “SoK:”
- check the SoK checkbox on the submission form to flag them for the review process.

# Tool/Benchmark Papers

JSys will publish papers that present a new open-source tool or benchmark. The goal is to support work that provides significant value to the community, yet cannot appear at top venues since the techniques used may not be novel. A good benchmark may spur a lot of research and innovation (for example, see YCSB).

JSys will do a review of both the paper that introduces the tool/benchmark, and the artifact itself. In this sense, it will be similar to Artifact Evaluation at systems conferences such as SOSP, OSDI, and EuroSys. The artifact is expected to be well-documented, and easy-to-use by a third party.

Difference with research papers that build systems.A number of research papers also introduce new artifacts. JSys tool/benchmark papers differ in two important ways:

1. The tool/benchmark does not need to use novel techniques or advance the state-of-the-art in terms of research
2. The tool/benchmark needs to pass Artifact Evaluation to be accepted. This is mandatory (it is usually optional for research papers that introduce artifacts).

Tool papers will not rejected for:

- Lack of novelty in the techniques used by the tool (i.e “just engineering”)

Tool papers may be rejected for:

- Not clearly establishing what value the new tool/benchmark brings to the community
- If there are existing tools that are similar, the paper should explain why they aren’t enough
- Not passing artifact evaluation due to lack of documentation or being hard to use

Desk Rejections:

- The tool or benchmark is not available as open-source
- The tool or benchmark is not available for researchers to use for free (i.e there must be an academic license. It can still be sold to industry practitioners commercially).
- The tool or benchmark does not work with an open-source operating system such as Linux

Guideline for authors:

- Prefix the title of these papers with “Tool:” or “Benchmark:”
- Check the Tool or Benchmark checkbox on the submission form to flag them for the review process
- Please provide a link to the open-source tool/benchmark

# Problem Papers

JSys invites papers that present a new problem to the community. The problem must be well-motivated and clearly articulated. If similar problems have been identified in other contexts before, the Problem paper should draw parallels to such problems and describe how the problem identified in the paper is unique.

We hope that Problem papers will serve as calls for action for a particular class of problems. Well-motivated, carefully argued Problem papers should prove influential and should drive the community to invest in working on possible solutions.

Problem papers will not rejected for:

- Not presenting solutions to the problems presented in the paper
- Not building a system

Problem papers may be rejected for:

- Not establishing what is unique about the problem presented, and how it is different from existing problems
- Not establishing why the problem is important, and why the community should invest time in working on a solution

Guideline for authors:

- Prefix the title of these papers with “Problem:”
- Check the Problem checkbox on the submission form to flag them for the review process

# Solution Papers

JSys invites papers that present a new solution to a well-known problem. Solution papers are the closest to regular research papers in traditional conferences, and will be judged on how they improve the state-of-the-art.

Artifact Evaluation. Unlike regular conferences where artifact evaluation is optional, it is mandatory for solution papers. The solution must be realized in the form of an artifact, which must be publicly available and evaluated to be easily used by a third party. In this way, it will always be possible for someone else to build on, extend, or evaluate a JSys Solution paper.

Solution papers may be rejected for:

- Not establishing how the solution improves the state-of-the-art
- Not differentiating the solution from prior work attaching the same problem

Desk Rejections:

- Not providing the artifact as open-source for Artifact Evaluation

Guideline for authors:

- Prefix the title of these papers with “Solution:”
- Check the Solution checkbox on the submission form to flag them for the review process
