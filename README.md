# JSys website

The JSys website is statically built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and the amazing [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) plugin.

<!-- After commiting some changes to the `sources` branch, you'll need to run the
[publish.sh](publish.sh) script to publish the site at
[rescience.github.io](rescience.github.io). -->

Many thanks to the [Rescience journal](rescience.github.io) for making their website code open source, it made our life much easier and faster to set up JSys! 🔓😁🚀
