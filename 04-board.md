# Editorial board

The editorial board of JSys is made of people committed to open access for all, open review, and high-quality feedback. It is composed for three independent groups,

- [Area boards](#area-boards)
- [Artifact evaluation board](#artifact-evaluation-board)
- [Student editorial board](#student-editorial-board)

which are coordinated by the journal's [Editors-in-Chief](#editors-in-chief). 

<!-- > JSys is forever grateful for the initial work of its [co-founders](#co-founders). -->
