<h3>Publication decisions</h3>

<p><strong>Evaluation Process</strong><br>

The editor is responsible for deciding which of the articles submitted to Hyperrhiz should be published. The editor may be guided by the policies of the our editorial board and constrained by such legal requirements as shall then be in force regarding libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism. The editor may confer with other editors or reviewers in making this decision.</p>

<p>Following initial evaluation the editor shall send out promising works for further evaluation by qualified reviewers. Every effort will be made to anonymize submissions for review; however, we acknowledge that in the case of complex multimedia or art works such practice may be impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Nondiscrimination</strong><br>

The editor will at any time evaluate manuscripts for their intellectual content without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, or political philosophy of the authors.</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>

The editor and any editorial staff will not disclose any information about a submitted manuscript to anyone other than the corresponding author, reviewers, potential reviewers, other editorial advisers, and the publisher, as appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure and conflicts of interest</strong><br>

Unpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript must not be used in an editor's own research without the express written consent of the author.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Duties of Reviewers</h3>

<p><strong>Contribution to Editorial Decisions</strong><br>

Peer review assists the editor in making editorial decisions and through the editorial communications with the author may also assist the author in improving the paper.</p>

<p><strong>Promptness</strong><br>

Any selected referee who feels unqualified to review the research reported in a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be impossible should notify the editor and excuse himself or herself from the review process.</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>

Any manuscripts received for review must be treated as confidential documents. They must not be shown to or discussed with others except as authorized by the editor.</p>

<p><strong>Standards of Objectivity</strong><br>

Reviews should be conducted objectively. Personal criticism of the author is inappropriate. </p>

<p>Referees should express their views clearly with supporting arguments.</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledgement of Sources</strong><br>

Reviewers should identify relevant published work that has not been cited by the authors. Any statement that an observation, derivation, or argument had been previously reported should be accompanied by the relevant citation. A reviewer should also call to the editor's attention any substantial similarity or overlap between the manuscript under consideration and any other published paper of which they have personal knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure and Conflict of Interest</strong><br>

Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be kept confidential and not used for personal advantage. Reviewers should not consider manuscripts in which they have conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or institutions connected to the papers.</p>

<hr><h3>Duties of Authors</h3>

<p><strong>Reporting standards</strong><br>

Authors of reports of original research should present an accurate account of the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. Underlying data should be represented accurately in the paper. A paper should contain sufficient detail and references to permit others to replicate the work. Fraudulent or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical behavior and are unacceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Data Access and Retention</strong><br>

While not required, authors are offered the option of providing raw data or other files in connection with a paper for editorial review, and at publication encouraged to provide, at their discretion, downloadable data and source files for the purposes of scholarly inquiry and (with permission) remix.</p>

<p><strong>Originality and Plagiarism</strong><br>

The authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, and if the authors have used the work and/or words of others that this has been appropriately cited or quoted.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple, Redundant or Concurrent Publication</strong><br>

An author should not in general publish identical or substantively similar written manuscripts in more than one journal or primary publication. Submitting the same manuscript to more than one journal concurrently constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Creative art works may at the discretion of the editor be republished in Hyperrhiz, in keeping with the ethos of gallery exhibition (rather than print publication), provided the author acknowledges previous exhibition in other venues.</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledgement of Sources</strong><br>

Proper acknowledgment of the work of others must always be given. Authors should cite publications that have been influential in determining the nature of the reported work.</p>

<p><strong>Authorship of the Paper</strong><br>

Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study. All those who have made significant contributions should be listed as co-authors. Where there are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the research project, they should be acknowledged or listed as contributors. The corresponding author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no inappropriate co-authors are included on the paper, and that all co-authors have seen and approved the final version of the paper and have agreed to its submission for publication.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest</strong><br>

All authors should disclose in their manuscript any financial or other substantive conflict of interest that might be construed to influence the results or interpretation of their manuscript. All sources of financial support for the project should be disclosed.</p>

<p><strong>Fundamental errors in published works</strong><br>

When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in his/her own published work, it is the authorâ€™s obligation to promptly notify the journal editor or publisher and cooperate with the editor to retract or correct the paper.</p>
