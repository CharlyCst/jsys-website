## Sample issue

This is a sample issue 1. Files include a working example of the footnoting system, multiauthor citation, and a sample "special feature" subsection. 

Each issue is based on the Jekyll "collections" system. The index file in the root of each collection specifies basic info and the "category_menu" layout generates a table of contents.

When customizing, create a new collection for each issue. Write your yml carefully. If you have weird quotes that you want to put in there, use the |- method to escape them upfront. There's an example in the bios.yml file in the data folder.
